"2017/07/26 2:14:42 PM MDT","","","Yes, I thought of a singular event that the words pertained to and did my best to imagine each verb happen in the order they were presented in, but not so much of a particular time, more of just the place I would see each sequence happening. My imagery wasn't too personal for a lot of them, but using people or objects I have seen before to enact and set each scene in my mind helped.

- 2 scramble: I tried to imagine each verb happen as I saw the story I was creating in my mind taking place, it took more time than say the 'intact' sequences because they were more specific and random from what normally would happen. 
- 3 intact: For this I didn't really think of a singular event, but as a scheme because that is the general order we would see when trying to create a product for consumers.
- 4 scramble: Like #2, it took me some time to memorize these words due to their not normal order and I used imagery for each verb to create a story in my mind.
- 5 intact: again like #3, It was presented in an order that is usually seen in real life and I did use imagery to create a story in my mind of the events taking place.
- 6 random: As I was told, I didn't try to remember these but after seeing them a few times I was able to figure out how they were related.
- 7 scramble: for this one I figured out the verbs were related to a baby.  I didn't try to visualize them taking place, so I found it more helpful to try to pair the words in a way that made it easier to remember them. i.e. conceive: raise are in order, and deliver: carry are in another order that we would see the verbs being taken place.
- 8 random: same as #6
- 9 intact: same as #5. Except I also tried to make these events emotionally charged to remember them better. So I imagined a child doing this and the reactions he/she would have had on their face.
- 10 scramble: same as #4
- 11 intact: same as # 5
- 12 scramble: same as #4
- 13 intact: same as #5
- 14 random: same as #6
- 15 scramble: same as #4
- 16 intact: same as #5","I didn't try to think of any similar events that had happened to me, just the generalized schemes that could be imagined. I tried to create their own unique 'stories' in my mind for each sequence. I did pull in information of what I did know from similar and related events I had experienced or known for each verb and the sequence they were a part of.","No, they were more like short segments sewed together like what we would see of montages on cartoon shows. Some times each action had a smooth transition to the next if the order made sense and could physically be done or the events  would have the verb happen smoothly but in reality would be psychically impossible.
i.e. #15 scramble: the verbs order would all happen smoothly smoothly because they can all be demonstrated in the order presented in real life.
i.e. #2: I would have little 'cut scenes' for each verb and piece them together in a memorable way that made it easier for me to remember, that would be like the montage example we would see in cartoon shows.
i.e. #5: This would be an example where each verb would have a smooth transition but in reality impossible to see happen instantly like what I did in my mind. ","",""

"2017/09/21 3:09:37 PM MDT","","","For the scanner tasks, I did not focus on recalling some specific episode and instead tried to focus on the general meaning of the individual verbs. Maybe I would have been more likely to have if there were not random sequences which makes that strategy less useful if you can't immediately remember which sequences are random and which are not. 

I did make more concrete episodes during the behavioral learning/testing phase which I am sure carried over to the scanner session to some degree. Here, the random sequences I purposefully tried not to incorporate into an episode, as it was pointless and could hinder the retention of the critical sequences. But still, they formed some kind of event.


intact - 2 - I thought of a typical drunk driving arrest, maybe like the ones in some commercial.

scrambled - 3 - I thought of some marketing company selling products.

random - 4 -  I thought of people going to war

intact - 5 - I thought of a date leading to a marriage, but the episode was the meeting/date, and the marriage was just going to happen in the future.

scrambled - 6 - I thought of a produce farm scene, like the farms you see in the central valleys of California. 

intact - 7 - I thought of a birth in a hospital.

scrambled - 8 - I constructed a weird restaurant scene where someone arrived already eating food and brought a book to read. 

intact - 9 - I thought of burning leaves  in the woods like I did when I was a kid. The destroy and extinguish were just possible outcomes.

random - 10 - I thought of recess as a kid, doing random different things each day.

scrambled - 11 - I thought of a child spilling something and remembered it was out of order but the first letters went c-s-c-s-c (I only used the letters strategy for the testing part)

scrambled - 12 - I thought of a vague letter writing scene but it wasn't very concrete because it was scrambled and no one writes letters anymore.

intact - 13 - I thought of playing basketball. The ""pass"" throws the episode off a little bit because it implies a change of subject. 

scrambled - 14 - I made some vague legal scenario where people were still investigating after the trial. 

random - 15 - I grouped all the verbs into a general shower/shaving event where order didn't matter.

intact - 16 - I thought of some recent graduate applying to jobs.","
Like mentioned above, more so in the first tasks and less in the scanner session. But yes, I merged the concepts in to some kind of event or sequence.
","
For the non-random sequences, I think the first or second verb in the sequence defined the representation and the other verbs just added on to it. But they were usually from the perspective of the initial events. The exception might be the DUI one, where the later information (the arrest) became more salient and defined the episode. 

For other ones, especially the random sequences and some of the scrambled ones, there was not really a stable episode or event. Just a general, less temporally constrained, associative scene which would allow any subsequent but related verb to occur.","No","I did use knowledge of the trial conditions to make responses. That is, recalling based on the first word of a sequence that ""this is a congruent sequence/a scrambled one/random"". I also sometimes constructed some kind of scene (see below).
"
"2017/09/27 3:07:18 PM MDT","2 - scrambled - This sequence logically made no sense. When It came to scrambled ones like this I kind of used my own logic. Like you were stopped because you swerved, you swerved because you had a drink, you were arrested because of the drink, and you drove. 
3 - Intact-  This one I was able to remember because it is basically in the order in which things occur. To me it was easy to remember because it just made sense. 
4-random- This one did not need to be remembered as it was always random. 
5-Scramble- I found this one hard to remember because of course its not how I would characterize a relationship to occur. I tried to picture a senerio in which this would happen and it kind of made me think of ""90 day fiance"" 
6-Intact- Again this one was in logical order and I could picture this because at home we do alot of gardening so I could see myself going through this process 
7-intact- I found this one rather easy to remember because it was in logical order of events. This is how I see this life event to occur. 
8-Scramble- I tried my best to remember this one and tried to more like memorize with repetition but I couldn't come up with a way to really remember it.
9- Intact- Again this one was easy to remember because I could picture like a way a fire starts and the words were in logical order. 
10-Scramble- I could not find a single way to actually try and memorize this one.  
11-Random- couldnt even try 
12- Intact- Persoanlly i dont write letters but this one was very easy to picture.

Others I tired to paint pictures in my head of what these things might look like ","no, I used different events or senerios for different ones ","No, I didn't relate any of the sequences to the others. ","no, All the sequences I related to their own thing. ","",""
"2017/10/12 3:03:45 PM MDT","intact - 2 - drink then drive didn't make sense, but once swerve came up, realized that it was related to drunk driving, so I tried to follow logical steps if someone were to get pulled over for drunk driving. 

scrambled - 3 - was able to figure out this was related to making a product, but it was out of order, so could remember manufacture came after market because they both started with ""m"", but then sell and develop confused, and remembered research was last because I do research.

intact - 4 - thought of steps someone who joined army would take. it followed logical order, so was able to remember.

random1 - 5 - this was difficult to remember because it was out of order sometimes, but they were all related to dating and marriage, so having been exposed to a lot of tv and real life situations, was easy to remember words, but difficult to understand order because it was logical sometimes, and mixed up the next.

scrambled - 6 - again, was able to remember first two words in the same order, but got confused for words 3,4,5 of sequence because they were in non-logical order.

intact - 7- just thought of the steps of a couple getting pregnant and having a child.

scrambled - 8- read followed by chew didn't seem related, but then chew made sense with the other words. It was easy to tell it was someone who would go to a restaurant. I just went to a restaurant this weekend and had to wait a good 20 minutes for a table, so wait was fresh in my mind and unpleasant, even though generally a patient person. I still did not associate ""read"" with reading a menu until after the second pass.

intact - 9- Realized this had to do with a fire, but for some reason thought of spreading mayo on bread, instead of a fire spreading the first couple of times. 

random2 - 10 - These sports actions, most of them I thought of baseball, even though I don't play and only watched a couple times. For tag, I thought of playing tag with friends as a child.

scrambled - 11 - This was challenging, but remembered the outside words ""cry"" and ""console"" because they related to each other, and sip I just memorized as being after cry. I had to remember ""clean"" and ""spill"" as coming together, but I think once I put ""spill"" before ""clean"" because it was more logical that way. I remembered 3 sets of words: cry/console, sip, clean/spill.

scrambled - 12 - was able to associate open/seal together, but send/write/postmark were difficult to remember because out of order. i just had to remember postmark was last and would often mix up the order of ""send"" and ""write"" because out of sequence.

intact -13 - had a picture of someone playing basketball in my head. I thought of Kobe Bryant dribbling and passing and Derek Fisher shooting a 3-pointer. Also, passing I thought of myself passing the ball to my friend during high school basketball try-outs.

random3 - 14 - I could  put these together as taking place in a court house, but difficult to remember in the order presented because learned as a different order in real life/ seen on tv shows. Also not a fan of law or tv shows, so don't really pay attention to the order, but know most from crime shows like CSI.

intact - 15 - Just thought of someone taking a shower, had the phrase ""lather, rinse, repeat"" stuck in my head. Thought of the commercials of women splashing their face with water for ""rinse"" and thought of Dove commercial for ""moisturize.""

scrambled - 16 - Thought of my own experience of applying to school, graduating, trying to save money. Had difficulty remembering this sequence because the process is so ingrained into my memory and school culture that was hard to place out of order and remember new ordering.




","Most was experience, either doing myself or seeing it be done by others or on TV.

scrambled - 3- I thought of the show ""Shark Tank"" where people develop an idea and ask investors to back them for manufacturing and marketing so they could sell product.

intact -4- remembered an Army commercial where it shows a person training, then being deployed, and fighting. also thought of all the news clips of soliders returning to surprise their children.

scrambled - 6 - Thought of when I sprouted lima beans in elementary school.

scrambled -8- Thought of going to restaurant over the weekend.

intact - 9 - for ""spread"" thought of a more closer experience of spreading mayonnaise on bread instead of a fire spreading because it was more relatable to myself. I am learn by doing, so couldn't think of abstract fire spreading, even though I hear and see it on the news a lot, but actually spreading the mayo made sense to me.

scrambled - 11 - Thought of me consoling a distressed friend. Spill/clean remembered a story my mom told me about her spilling her drink during her family dinners and her mom cleaning it up.

intact - 13 - Thought of watching basketball (2003 Lakers to be exact - best roster).

intact - 15 - just thought of commercials and actually taking a shower/doing.

scrambled - 16 - going to school/college and seeing others apply for jobs.","Most sequences I thought of a specific time and place, for an example, whether it was my own life and experience or something I had seen on TV.","Sometimes I would think of more than one example of the verb during the same sequence, or think of the second example the second time I saw the same sequence.","No, I just thought of single examples from one specific day.","",""

"2017/11/01 11:38:23 AM MDT","intact - 2 - I used a script of a vague storyline (some kind of semantic knowledge). After the first presentation of drink-drive, I was already predicting the general narrative.  But I never visualized a specific episode, more of a general story.

random1 - 3 - Only after the first presentation of the whole sequence was I able to group these words together, based on their common relation to a generic process of product development.  This was grouping was entirely based on meaning.

scrambled - 4 - Starting with the first presentation of the second word (deploy), I tried to visualized a generic sequence of events that I have no experience with, and that plays out over a long time.  It wasn't until ""enlist"" was presented fourth that I realized the events were out of order.  So on the second presentation, I thought explicitly about how a fighting unit could train after being deployed.  But could not enlist after training.  And of course there's a happy ending to the sequence - returning.  I think I briefly recalled some scenes from movies, especially in the first presentation, to help solidify memory for the verbs/phases of the sequence (because I have no personal experience). 

intact - 5 - This sequence felt very easy to remember, because of current personal experience.  I have been helping a friend plan a wedding (for this Saturday).  I lived with him when he met, started dating, and proposed to his fiancee, so I've been reflecting on this sequence of events for the last few weeks.  Essentially, I just related the events to his experience and phases of my own relationship, but I only briefly thought of specific episodes of my own life (but rather, was thinking more about general time periods).

scrambled - 6 - This first presentation was difficult to manage, because ""eat"" did not prime me for ""harvest"".  But as an avid gardener, I quickly recognized the process after this second word.  After the first presentation of the full sequence, I realized these events could simply be in reverse order (but I mixed up water -> grow on the second presentation, because my strategy didn't account for the fact that both happen after planting and before harvest).

intact - 7 - I used a similar strategy for this sequence as for ""intact-5"" above.  Two other friends of mine are about to become parents.  I was at their baby shower two weeks ago, so in addition to bringing to mind basic knowledge about the different phases of this sequence of events, I was also thinking about conversations with my friend over the past few months - getting his unique & often hilarious views about the carrying, delivering, naming, and raising phases.  Those recent conversations likely influenced my ratings of pleasantness.
 

scrambled - 8 - This sequence was very difficult.  ""Read"" is not very strongly associated with ""chew"", so I was not aware this was a restaurant-based event until after the first full presentation of the sequence.   I was think able to think of them in a sort of reverse order, but with read in the first position, when it should be last (ie, read, order, sit, wait, chew).  But that order of events isn't quite right, and it took another couple presentations before I was able to solidify that ""wait"" comes before ""sit"".  I wasn't thinking of any specific events for this - just trying to put pieces of a generic script in order. 

intact - 9 - On first presentation, light was ambiguous (as one could light the way/room rather than the fire).  But ""burn"" made the event obvious.  As a strong advocate of campfire safety, this sequence was easy to conjure up images of generic events.  While I have no real personal experience with a large spreading fire, I have enough experience with fire (and have seen enough recent images of wildfires in the newss) that I could conjure fairly vivid images of each phase of this sequence.

scrambled - 10 - This one was also difficult to remember the sequence, but after the  second presentation, I simply thought of them in order, but with ""hit""/""run"" reversed and ""swing"" flipped to the end rather than the beginning.  I suppose I have enough personal experience with this sequence, from playing and watching baseball, that I was able to do the heavy lifting of re-arranging the items fairly easily because I could conjure a generic image of each action.  And maybe also because the events play out in a very short time?
Note that this sequence was somewhat more difficult to remember in the first two presentations because I recently saw two friends in a fistfight, so ""hit"" initially cued me to a different event.  But after two presentations, ""hit"" was immediately cuing a baseball scene, rather than a fight.

random2 - 11 - This group was somewhat difficult because I have very little personal or second-hand experience with small kids and their messes.  However, and I was able to visualize my niece and sister in generic versions of these events, and in that way group them together.  Again, this grouping might have benefited from the fact that the events happen within a short time period (in contrast, for example, to the generic events in ""scrambled-4"" or ""scrambled-8"" above).

intact - 12 - This sequence was pretty easy to remember, after the first presentation of seal and postmark.  I enjoy writing physical letters and sending/receiving actual mail, and so I was able to draw on recent personal experiences writing to my grandmother to remember the sequence of verbs.

scrambled - 13 - This sequence was initially difficult, because it was obvious that the  events were out of order.  However, I have a lot of personal experience playing and watching basketball, so the meaning/utility/importance of each action within the greater context is obvious to me.  I broke this into multiple phases:  Jump to score. Look to pass before you shoot.  No one dribbles anymore.

random3 - 14 - While the order of these events were scrambled on each presentation, it was fairly easy to link each verb to current events, even on the first presentation of the sequence, and to feel optimistic that ongoing federal investigations will lead the Presi-perpetrator to be indicted, tried, and sentenced. I've closely followed the ongoing investigations, and major developments announced Friday & Monday preceded my participation on Monday.  So I was able to conjure up images & strong emotions regarding specific events that have not yet transpired (but hopefully will), in order to group these verbs together. 

intact - 15 - This sequence was also fairly easy to remember from the first presentation.  ""Lather"" is a pretty specific signal of the context, and as a beardy guy, I have plenty of experience with these events.  Moisturizing is for the weak-of-skin and weak-of-heart.

scrambled - 16 - These events are very generic in nature, and play out over a long-time, so this sequence was somewhat difficult to learn.  But after a couple presentations of the sequence, I was able think of the verbs somewhat in order - a non-traditional grad student works, then applies to become a graduate student.  It is very difficult to save while a grad student, and even more difficult to do job interviews while trying to finish a dissertation!","Yes, in a lot of cases, I used verbal knowledge.

** Note I ignore sequence #1, which is not in the spreadsheet list.","Not on every trial, but in a few of the sequences, such as #5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15.  
In many of these sequences, there was more than one episodic event that came to mind during the sequence (such as different words in a sequence would cue different events), but typically a word would cue the same event each time it was presented.
Note that in some cases (e.g., hit), the singular event that came to mind was not the right context (see above, fight vs baseball).","Yes, in a lot of cases, I was thinking of a merging of many events.
In fact, listing out the sequence #s, it seems like almost every sequence involved this kind of ""merging of memories"".","Yes, for many of the events, including #3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 16.","",""

"2018/02/08 4:03:59 PM MST"," 'scrambled'	2 : In general, I merged similar events together. After the second sequence, I realized this was scrambled in an illogical way, but still retained the same sequence. For these types of problems, I try to remember the first two terms and the very last term. I let myself slowly remember these types after seeing the sequences a few more times. It definitely helped to use verbal knowledge. Just saying the words out loud helped refine this memory. 
'intact'	3: I thought of a singular event for this one. My Dad works at an R&D company so I would think about the process that he has to go through. Also this was an intact sequence so some of it was intuitive. 
'random1'	4 : Since this was constantly random, I tried to picture the overall event going on. I then pieced this together to multiple events in my mind. My family is military, and I have close friends that are military so the terms are already stuck in my head. 
'scrambled'	5 : This sequence confused me since I kept forgetting it was not an intact sequence. The terms Marry > Meet > Propose was completely backwards and threw me off. I remembered date > celebrate easily, but the last three confused me. After a few sequences, I tied this together with a backwards cheesy romance movie . This ultimately helped with the last three terms. 
'intact'	6 : This was easy since I recently grew plants back in my apartment so this information was readily accessible. I tied this together to a singular event of me growing green onions. Also, since the sequence is intact, most of it is intuitive. 
'intact'	7 : This intact sequence was a bit harder since I'm not familiar with the terms as well. I ultimately tied this together with my Development Psych class, that deals a lot with this. As usual, I remembered the first two terms, and the very last one. From there, it was easier to tell that you would generally want to Deliver > Name > Raise.
'scrambled'	8 : This one was a bit harder since it was scrambled. I've worked multiple food service jobs before so I was able to merge together multiple events. In the end, it was easier to not think about the entire event, rather the terms themselves. I used the same strategy as before, where I remembered most of the beginning sequence and the very end. I relied on seeing this sequence multiple times to remember it rather than memorizing it from the start. 
'random2'	9 : This was definitely the hardest sequence for me.  For some reason, I didn't piece together the whole event as a fire burning down something. I took each word at face value which probably lead to these words being unfamiliar for me. I mostly relied on seeing the terms multiple times to get the ""familiar"" feeling. 
'scrambled'	10 : This was one of the harder sequences to remember. The words Hit>  Slide just didn't stick. In the end, this was one of the sequences that seems a bit unfamiliar. However, I tried to tie this together with the movie Sandlot, but that only helped a little. In the end, the only parts that actually stuck was the word Run and Tag>Swing 
'intact'	11 : This was an easy sequence to remember. The sequence is logical and I have a baby sister at home. It was easy to imagine my parents going through this exact sequence.
'random3'	12: Along with the fire sequence, this was another hard sequence to remember. I tied this to a movie's title to try and remember this. The words I had a hard time with was seal and postmark. I kept thinking of the animal seal, which might have helped remember the word, but not the overall sequence. Postmark was a bit hard since I don't really use this word in everyday conversations so it seemed a bit foreign. 
'intact'	13 : This was a bit easier since my girlfriend is a basketball fan. Therefore, I am forced to watch some games with her. I ultimately merged together multiple events of us watching games along with the basic premise of the game. 
'scrambled'	14 : Some of the words in this sequence were foreign to me, but I automatically tied this together to the court scenes in Law & Order and CSI. Since I didn't know the exact definitions of each word, I feel like it helped me remember the scrambled sequence. I used my usual strategy of remembering the first two terms and the very last one. However, I often caught myself switching perpetrate with indict until I had more practice.
'intact'	15 : This was another easy sequence since shaving is a major milestone as a male. I think back to a singular event where I first used a razor, and not an electric shaver. My process then was the exact same as this sequence, so remembering that event helped refine this. 
'scrambled'	16: This sequence was a bit weird, but it was pretty relevant to me as a college student. Although the terms were scrambled, they didn't seem as confusing as the other scrambled sequences. In fact, some of the terms made sense to me for some reason. I tied this together with the movie Stepbrothers and how their interview went all wrong. This also helped refine the fact that this sequence is not supposed to make sense. ","","","","","",""

I clearly pictured (visualized) someone (or myself... it wasn't clear who was the ""antagonist"" in this ""story"") doing this intact list of words. These words were pretty heavily linked to each other in my memory of the order. They also felt clearly memorable as being part of this ""story"". When answering questions about this kind of clear, intact list I would often answer the questions from the perspective of how the word is in the context of the story (even if it has multiple meanings). For example, arrest could have multiple meanings but I'm fairly sure I always thought of it as a police officer arresting someone (as opposed to cardiac arrest, etc) I'll refer to this as ""context-hard"".

'random1'	3 - 
I largely thought of these words as separate. For words that have multiple meanings (like develop) I would often answer the questions in a way that would make sense from the perspective of any of the meanings when answering questions about these individual words. I'll refer to this as ""context-soft"" Harder to remember order
'scrambled'	4 - 
For this list, I pictured someone (not myself) in a sort of story. They fought in a bar fight, caused them to deploy, train, etc. but obviously the order often threw me off. The words that were clearly out of order (especially enlist) were hard to remember how they fit. Most of these words didn't have multiple meanings that I'm aware of.
'intact'	5 - 
Interestingly, I didn't picture this one as a story or visualization. I suppose I thought of this one as what you describe as verbal knowledge - they make sense in the order they're presented. It made it much easier to remember the order. No obvious multiple-meaning words
'scrambled'	6 - 
I pictured someone doing these tasks but the scrambled order of the words made it difficult to remember the order. No multi-meaning words
'random2'	7
I thought of these as being all part of the same general picture (conceiving and raising a child). It wasn't as clear of a mental image as the drinking and driving one but it was pretty easy to remember the order because they make sense in the order given. It's interesting that these were randomized because they make sense in the order listed. Most were context-hard but I thought of carry mostly like you would with arms, not in womb.
'intact'	8 - 
This was visualized similar to the drink,drive sequence. It wasn't as vivid as that one but the words also just make sense in the order they're in so it wasn't difficult to remember the order of these. mostly context-hard
'scrambled'	9 - 
These were all part of the same event but being out of order like they were made it very difficult to remember order. When answering questions about these I often thought of the words from multiple perspectives (ie thinking about words that have multiple meanings from the point of view of those multiple meanings to see if they fit the question) rather than thinking of them as having the meaning within the context of the word group. This group was pretty context-soft
'intact'	10 - 
This was pictured similar to the drink,drive list. Not quite as vivid, and I thought of it being someone else more than myself doing it. Context-soft - especially slide and hit
'scrambled'	11 - 
I imagined a scenario where someone cries, takes a sip of something, cleans the table, spills their cup in their clumsy state and then someone consoles them. it worked well for the order this happened to be in and was relatively easy to remember. Context-hard (though most dont have any multi-meaning)
'intact'	12 - 
I imagined this scenario but I had a hard time remembering it, possibly because I haven't done much with letters in long time! And haven't done any of the individual parts much. not many multi-meanings
'random3'	13 - 
This one was clearly visualized. It seems to be in a good order even though it's randomized. Was very easy to remember order. this was quite context-hard especially the word shoot (though I think I thought of it as shooting with a gun at least once. not sure)

Visualized myself doing these things. Made it easy to remember order. relatively context-hard
'scrambled'	16 - 
This was partly visualized but I think I also used verbal knowledge since they seemed to make sense in this order.

'scrambled'	7 This one was hard for me to remember. I know that there is a logical chronological order but this one was all sorts of jumbled up. I think I said that you give a name to the baby you want, then you conceive it, you raise it in your belly, then you deliver it (like give birth) ten you will physically carry it in your arms  
'intact'	8 For whatever reason this was kind of hard for me to remember at first but then I was able to recall a memory that helped me recall this list better. I remembered what happened when a friend and I went to Applebee's. We first  had to sit, read the menu and then order. We waited for the food until the waitress brought it and then we were able to start eating (chewing). 
'scrambled'	9 This was a hard one to remember too. I also just forced a connection. I think i just said you are you to extinguish a fire that destroyed and burned a building. Then you're going to have a bad guy come and light it up again and its going to spread. My thinking process is a little extra. But for whatever reason while I was learning the words, this made the most sense to me 
'random2'	10This one i also just didnt spend much time learning the words. I knew that whenever i saw the green i would just have to fill in 1-5 so i didnt spend much time learning the words 
'intact'	11- I think I was reminded of a commercial? Even though it was in chronological order, i still played an image in my head of a little girl drinking milk, taking a sip out of a cup that was too big for her, she would take a sip but then spill it all over the table. She would start crying and then the mother would rush over and comfort the child. Then once the girl stopped crying then mother would start cleaning. I know that this is all in order but I think having the image in my head helped me learn it better 
'intact'	12- The one just made sense and I didnt have to remember much. i just had to remember that write was in chronological order so I would just need to categorize in a way that just made sense 
'scrambled'	13 this one was hard to learn, and i dont know if i confidently learned this either. i was constantly getting this wrong. Im not a huge basketball fan so i couldn't really bring up an image that could help me remember the word order 
'random3'	14 Same reasoning, I knew I would fill in 12345 so I did not learn it 
'intact'	15 Personal experience, it just makes sense because this is exactly what I do 
'scrambled'	16 - This was also hard to remember but I forced a correlation between the words. I said that you work and then you apply to graduate. Once you graduate you have to save money and get an interview or something. It is so forced but I think I made it work because i knew that it was the order that the words came in","Not often but there were only a few cases in which it happened like so ","Some word order lead itself to be remembered in one event while others needed to be remembered over a ""series"" of days ","Always. If I tried memorizing the words on their own I would have a much harder time trying to recall the word ","I wouldn't say that i did so with all the word choices but for some of them i would say so","",""
"2018/03/27 7:06:40 PM MDT","'scrambled'	2 -  Recognized that this was scrambled. Thought of the fact that if one were experiencing a car crash, things would seem very mixed up, confusing, traumatizing, to try to remind myself that they did not follow an inherent order. Used the acronym ""S.S. Dad"" (like a boat) to remember the proper order. A friend of mine has a car that is very large and has a poor turn radius, and we refer to it as the ""S.S. [Last Name]"" so the mental connection between boats and cars was a small mental step for me. 



'intact'	3 - Recognized that this followed an inherent order given the activities occurring. Identified the ordering of Research and Development ""R and D"" as something familiar to begin with. 



'random1'	4 - I recognized that these items were not presented in a consistent order (preceded by blue cross) and simply focused on answering the corresponding question (""is this an activity one would do at night"", etc.)

'scrambled'	5-- Recognized that this was presented consistently but not in a logical order. Focused on the middle three words of the sequence (""celebrate"", ""marry"", and ""meet"") by thinking that one were celebrating a person named Mary. Also thought of the line from Hamlet, to paraphrase-- how the funeral meats did the wedding feast make, to remember that they were CELEBRATING the MARRIAGE with the funeral MEAT (meet). ""Date"" and ""propose"" were in a logical order, relative to one another, and I did not give them much consideration. 

'intact'	6 -- I recognized that this followed an inherent, logical, and consistent order. I tried to focus during the activity on remembering which sequences did comply with what would seem the logical order. 

'intact'	7-- In the course of the television series ""The Office"", the two main characters have a daughter named Cecelia, nicknamed CeCe. I used this to remember that Conceive and Carry came first in this sequence. Seeing that the first two items were in a logical sequence reminded me that what followed was also in a proper sequence. 

'scrambled'	8-- I had difficulty with this one. I remembered that ""Wait"" and ""sit"" (shared suffix of -it) were adjacent, but had difficulty remembering their location in the sequence. 

'intact'	9 -- A friend of mine recently had their house nearly destroyed by the Sonoma fires. By thinking of him, I remembered that this maintained a logical sequence. 

'scrambled'	10 -- I ran cross country and track during high school, so the word ""run"" immediately drew my attention. My high school's initials were RHS (hence the first three words). I mentally rehearsed ""RHS-TS"" a few times. I did have difficulty remembering which S word was first in the sequence. 

'random2'	11-- See Random 1

'scrambled'	12-- When I lived in Germany, I often wrote to my boyfriend at night. I remember specifically going to Deutsche Post offices just before they closed in order to purchase postage on at least three occasions. I thought of this fact (that visiting the DP office often occurred late in my day) in order to help remember that ""postmark"" was last. ""Open"" and ""Seal"" I linked because they were opposites. I also thought of the running gag from Arrested Development ""loose seal""/""lucille"" and connected opening with loosening something. With this sequence and others, I used the fact that there were two sequential instances of the same initial letter (here, S and S for seal and send) to remind myself of the proper order.

'intact'	13-- Though I accidentally marked these incorrectly a number of times, I clung to the phrase ""he shoots, he scores!"" to remember the order of the last two words in this sequence. I also tried to focus on remembering DPJ to keep the first three words in order. Dribble was relatively easy to remember, because when I initially encountered it, I was puzzled as to whether it would be referring to dribbling a liquid, or the action with a basketball. This novelty helped to remind me that ""dribble"" was first in this sequence. For PJ, I thought of pajamas and the fact that using the initials ""_.J."" is common. 

'scrambled'	14 Thinking about the question about a child's involvement with these verbs made them seem to stick in my mind. I also remembered that ""try"" and ""investigate"" were the only ones that had fairly positive connotations in my mind and that these book ended the sequence. Also, I remembered that the two I words were adjacent. 

'random3'	15 -- See Random 1

'intact'	16 -- This sequence was easy to remember because I am a recent graduate, who just went through the process of ""apply[ing]"" and ""interview[ing]"". Last week, I began working at a new job and I desperately need to save money before beginning law school this Fall. Because the events detailed in this sequence have been so close to my focus for the last few months, it was easy to remember that this was in the proper order. 

While I was participating in these activities, I was trying to formulate these methods of memorizing. In some instances, I let a trigger finger get the best of me. In others, I did not think of an effective way to remember it until later in the activity. ","","","","","",""
"2018/04/19 9:48:29 AM MDT","'random1'	2 - for the random sequence I tried to not look at the word since I did not have to memorize the order of them and instead just did the 1-2-3-4-5 for those. 
'intact'	3 - For this sequence, I thought of how things go in businesses and the order made sense. 
'scrambled'	4 - I made little scenario in my head that would help me remember this order. I thought of a friend of mine in the army. 
'intact'	5 - This sequence just made sense because it is what traditionally happens. 
'scrambled'	6 - For this one, I knew it was not in order but I still pictured in my head me doing these steps and that helped me remember the order. 
'scrambled'	7 - For this one, I knew it was not in order but I still pictured in my head me doing these steps and that helped me remember the order. 
'intact'	8 - I pictured myself going to a restaurant and the steps that I would take to order and this sequence followed the steps. 
'scrambled'	9 -  I told myself that after you extinguish something it is most likely destroyed and that was caused because of the burn. Then I told myself after the bad (burn) there comes light and that lights spreads all around. 
'intact'	10 - I pictured this sequence in my head like a hit and run scenario replaying the steps as they appeared.

","I did use what I know and have seen in order to make sense of the sequences. ","It was more of just remembering things I have seen in like movies. ","I did this for the sequence with the graduate term in it because it was the only way to memorize this set. ","Not that I can recall. I did not use this method to help me remember the sequences. ","",""
"2018/05/11 9:57:24 AM MDT","'random1'	2  -  Even though this sequence was random, I played the same scene of a car crashing into a stop sign in my head whenever I was presented this set of verbs. After the first two times or so, I had remembered that this sequence was random and associated the car crash scene with any word in the sequence. 
'intact'	3 - I thought of this sequence in a logical order. The way I remembered it was knowing the proper steps to developing a product. I had learned about the steps of how a medicine gets from the lab to sales in the public (in a seminar based class) and I applied my knowledge there to easily remember the order of this sequence. 
'scrambled'	4 - At some point throughout the initial task I concluded that not all of the blue cross series were in logical order so I learned to associate a general term with them. Whenever this one came around, I immediately thought ""military"" and just committed myself to remembering the words in their scrambled order. When I saw the word ""fight"", I the other words would play out verbally in my head in order. 
'intact'	5 - I would say that I used verbal knowledge to remember this event. I haven't really ever observed the whole process of meeting, dating, proposing, marrying, and celebrating yet. I used what I thought was the normal order that these would occur based on what I know about how marriages start. 
'scrambled'	6 - The last three words (water, grow, plant""), I thought of as a sentence that Kevin from The Office would say. It's like someone is trying to say ""watering will grow the plant"" or something along those lines. I associated ""harvest"" with those three words since they are all relatively related in context. Then I had to associate ""eat"" with all of them while being careful not to think about sequence #8. For this one, I thought of a logical process and just committed to remembering the steps of the logical process being scrambled. 
'scrambled'	7 - I had some trouble with this one. I believe that this was the first sequence that showed up, and at this point I had not developed a strategy for remembering sequences. I committed this one to memory solely based on the order of the words and not the event itself. I just pieced together these five words which appeared to be related, but didn't actually picture the long term  merging of similar events until later when I had encountered them more in the study. 
'intact'	8 - I played a scene from Spongebob Squarepants in my head whenever this sequence came about. I associated this scene with the word ""sit"" so I could easily remember the sequence. 
'random2'	9 - Although it makes more sense to associate these words with a single event, I actually associated only ""burn"" and ""destroy"" with one event and each other word had their own separate event that I remembered. ""Spread"" made me think about a sandwich, ""light"" made me think about a flash light, and ""extinguish"" made me think about a fire extinguisher, but not in the context of a fire. I just associated each individual event/thought with the preceding one and went off there. 
'scrambled'	10 - I thought of my general experience in baseball as a teenager, but no event in particular. 
'intact'	11 - I played out a scene in my head (similar to my strategy in #1) to remember the order of this sequence. 
'scrambled'	12 - I did not think of a single scene, rather the concept of how mailing a letter works. Even though the sequence appears scrambled, I made it make sense to me so I could remember it easier. You open the envelope, put letter in, seal it, send it, your friend receives it and writes you back, then postmarks it for the mail. 
'random3'	13 - I associated these verbs all with a basketball game. No particular experience I've had came to mind, but I knew that all of these verbs had to do with basketball. However, the first time this came around, ""shoot"" was shown first and I automatically assumed it was talking about weapons. After the next verb came, I changed my mindset and associated them all with a basketball game. 
'intact'	14 - I remembered these verbs by recalling how the I perceived the judicial system to work from what I've been told. I have never experienced any of the verbs individually or the overall process itself. Also, ""perpetrate"" and ""investigate"" rhymed so it made it easier to remember the start of the sequence for me.
'scrambled'	15 - Only the word ""shave"" stood out to me for some reason. I just associated the other words with it as being ""bathroom related"" and remembered their order. ""Rinse"" and ""lather"" seemed like repeat words to me at the time, so I didn't bother to see the verbs as part of a process and just remembered them for their order. 
'intact'	16 - I knew that this was the general process for many graduates out of school from verbal knowledge and not experience. I just remembered the word ""graduate"" as being part of a logical order. 





","","","","","",""
"2018/05/18 11:19:15 AM MDT","'scrambled'	2 -  For this sequence, I thought of a story that helped me remember the order.
A man was stopped because he was swerving. The cop pulled him over and found out he was drinking. The man got arrested and had to be driven to the police station. 

I used all of the verbs in the correct sequence order in my story and thought about this story whenever I had to remember the order. The story wasn't based on a real life experience. I just made it up. 

'intact'	3 - For this sequence, I just took what I've learned in different business classes. I knew the order from learning about it before. 
 
'random1'	4 - Whenever I thought about this sequence, I would think of different things a soldier does in war. I thought about Forrest Gump a lot during this sequence. The main character does all the verbs in this sequence during the movie. 

'scrambled'	5 - This sequence was harder for me to memorize because I kept wanting to put it in the correct order.  What I tried to do to remember is think of another story. 

A couple dates and celebrates their anniversary. They finally get married and meet each others' families at the wedding. The groom's brother proposes to his girlfriend at the wedding. 

It didn't really make a lot of sense, but it helped me remember. I saw a video on-line of a groom's brother proposing at the wedding and that's how I came up with the last line. The rest I made up.

'intact'	6 - This sequence was easy for me to remember since it's in order. I thought of the farm to table process. I also thought of how you have to do all the hard work before getting to my favorite part, which is eating. 

'scrambled'	7 - I am scared of childbirth, but I like kids. So I remembered this sequence in a good/bad pattern. Naming a child is good. Conceiving a child is bad. Raising a child is good. Delivering is bad. Carrying a child is good. 

'intact'	8 -  I remembered the order of this sequence by using another story.

You sit at a restaurant and read until the waiter comes to you. You order your food and wait for it to come. You chew your food. 

I used my own experience dining at restaurants to make this story. 
The last word was especially easy for me to remember because my housemate's last name is Chew. 

'scrambled'	9 - This sequence was hard for me to remember. I didn't like any of the words except light. I felt that light was the only one that had a positive connotation. 

'random2'	10 - I remembered the words by thinking of things you do on a playground. You swing a bat and hit a ball. You run and play tag. You go on the swing. These are all things I've seen kids do at the park. 

'intact'	11 -  I thought of another story for this sequence. 
I thought about a little kid sipping from his sippy cup. I then imagined him spilling his milk and crying over it. His mom has to console him and clean it up.

Kids always spill and make a mess so it was easy for me to remember.  
I used the phrase ""crying over spilled milk"" and ""sipping sippy cup"" to better help me remember. 

'intact'	12 -  This sequence is easy because it's the order I send my mail in.  The only part I got confused with is seal and postmark, because those are interchangeable in the way I prep my letters. 

'scrambled'	13 - I remembered this sequence because I liked the first two words and not the last three. I remembered it because pass, shoot, and dribble get progressively worse. I think the word dribble is sounds really bad. 

'random3'	14 - I remembered the word sentence quickly, because I thought it meant like a sentence that has words. Then I realized that the sequence was not referring to that kind of sentence. I remembered the other words by thinking of things that happen during a crime. I know what happens during a crime investigation because of T.V shows. 

'intact'	15 - These are the exact steps I take when I shave my legs. They are in the same order too. 

'scrambled'	16 - I put these steps in a story.

I work hard in school so I can apply to graduate school. After, I'll have to save money to pay for student loans. I can save even more money if I interview and get a job.

It kind of has some logic behind it and it was easy for me to remember. I thought about what people do in college. ","","","","","",""
"2018/05/18 3:47:15 PM MDT","'intact'	2 -  
For this sequence, the order was relatively easy to remember. This sequence of events made sense as they happen in a natural order. The first two words ""drink"" and ""drive"" are used together a lot in everyday life, unfortunately, and just knowing that from having previous experience helped a lot in remembering the order and what the sequence was about.

'scrambled'	3 - 
This sequence I used two different methods. I was able to remember the first two words by committing to memory that the first two words started with the letter ""M"". Then, the phrase ""develop research"" put together made sense in my mind. The word ""sell"", I just kind of remembered by association especially to the word ""market"" (which reminded me of farmer's markets where they sell goods).

'intact'	4
This sequence was easy to remember, and I don't feel like I really made this sequence a priority because it was an easier sequence. Obviously, the order makes sense in terms of how individuals may enlist and be deployed to work in the armed forces. I thought about the order in which an individual may spend their time in the army and eventually return home. Again, this sequence followed a natural order.

'random1'	5
For this sequence, I associated the words by thinking of the process of how two people meeting someone they would want to spent their life with would follow. This would require meeting and getting to know them (dating), and then eventual proposal and marriage (if they like each other) and then celebrating the marriage.

'scrambled'	6
This sequence was also easy for me to remember. The order of it is exactly reversed. You start with ""eat"" and end with ""plant"". Everything in between are steps you would take to grow some sort of food or crop (ie water, harvest). I thought about the steps one takes when planting any edible plant and committed to memory that this sequence is the opposite of what one would typically think it would be.

'intact'	7
This order is typical in what you would see in the course of an individual having a child. First you conceive, then carry the fetus for 9 months before delivering the baby, naming it, and then having to raise it. This was very easy to remember because it is fairly common knowledge in society. Also, the first two words started with the letter ""C"" as well.

'scrambled'	8
This one was a little bit more difficult for me to remember the first time taking the test. I kept wanting to remember it in a sequence that made sense for possibly going to a restaurant and ordering food and eventually eating  (chew) it, but this wasn't helpful. Instead, I ended up trying to visually remember the first letter of each word RCWSO. For me, it helps if I am able to take the first letters and be able to pronounce it in my mind like it is it's own word. That way, I only need to remember one word (even if it isn't a real word).

'random2'	9
I associated this sequence of words with wildfires. I thought about how they first occur (light/ignite/etc) and what lighting something on fire would cause (burning of grass). Then this fire usually ""spread(s)"" and ""destroy(s)"" wildlife and eventually needs to be ""extinguish(ed)"".

'scrambled'	10
This sequence I used sort of the same method I used for sequence 8. These words reminded me of playing baseball, so the order here wouldn't make sense. For this sequence I remembered the first letter of every other word: R_S_S. This made sense to me because in the alphabet R comes before S. The other two words ""hit"" and ""tag"" I were able to remember which one came first because ""H"" comes before ""T"".

'intact'	11
This sequence was super easy to remember. It actually reminded me a lot of this memory I have from when I was about 6 where I was in a Taco Bell and tried to drink my soda with my elbows and it spilled all over me and I cried. After crying, my mom consoled me about it and helped me clean it up. The order is very obvious and also the anagram is easy to remember. SSCCC.

'scrambled'	12
This one I was able to remember to associating each word to the next word. I remembered that open came first, and after you open something you close it (seal). Then seal is related to the next word send because they start with the same letter ""S"". Then, I remembered send, and write as being the opposite of what  they should be (usually you write a letter before sending it). Then, the relationship of ""write"" and ""postmark"" should be in the correct order (you write a letter before postmarking it).

'random3'	13
This sequence I thought about the sport of basketball. You have a ball that you ""dribble"" and then ""pass"" to a teammate that catches it while ""jump(ing)"" and then ""scores"" for the team.

'intact'	14
This sequence I believe I got wrong every time I tried to guess the order. I think the length of the words threw me off a little bit (They are not one syllable, so harder to commit to memory). These words reminded me of the process a lawyer would go through in order to indict an individual who has committed a crime. I tried to remember that the first to words were the longest, ""perpetrate"" and ""investigate"" and that the next word after ""investigate"" had the same letter ""I"". After this, I could really find a good way to remember the last two letters and I think thats why I kept flipping them in my mind.

'scrambled'	15
This one I remember by remembering words from the opposite sides of the sequence and associating them. Like, moisture and lather I felt where somewhat similar so I remembered them being at opposite ends. Then, working inwards I associate ""rinse"" and ""dry"" as being opposites (wet, dry). Then, I remembered the center word as being the peak word (all the other words are preparatory in order to shave, which is the goal).

'intact'	16 -
This sequence I was able to apply to myself (as a student hopefully graduating next year) and know the order of very well. It is in an order that makes sense, and is a order that most society expects every to follow. I remembered that the sequence  started with what is expected of me next, ""to graduate"" and then from there on out, I knew what the order should be based on a typical pattern most individuals lives follow.

'random1'	4 - This was random so I did not memorize the sequence. However, all the words in this sequence were related to the military so anytime, I saw one of the words in this sequence I knew the rest would be randomized. 
'scrambled'	5 - For this sequence, the first two words rhyme and then the next two words start with 'm' and 'propose' is the last word - that's how I remember this sequence. I thought of many similar events where couples date and get married when remembering this sequence.
'intact'	6 - I understood this sequence to be related to the singular event of my mom gardening and as it happened in order, it was easy to remember.
'scrambled'	7 - I thought of a general event of a married couple giving birth and raising a kid to remember this sequence.
'random2'	8 - This sequence was random therefore I did not memorize it however all the words had to do with being at a restaurant, so I thought of the general event of restaurant whenever one of the words from this sequence came up. 
'scrambled'	9 - I thought of a singular event of fire spreading through a building but in reverse since 'extinguish' was the first word.
'intact'	10 - I thought of the general event of baseball to remember this sequence.
'intact'	11 - I thought of the singular event of my baby cousin drinking water and then spilling it and crying until her mom consoled her and cleaned the mess to remember this sequence. Also, it was easy to remember that the first two words start with 's' and the last 3 with 'c'
'scrambled'	12 - I thought of the general event of sending a letter to remember this sequence. Also two opposite words 'open' and 'seal' were one after the other which allowed for easy remembering and the longest word 'postmark' was at the end.
'intact'	13 - I thought of the general event of basketball being played to remember this sequence. 
'random3'	14 - I remember this sequence because all the words had to do with court of law. The words were random however any time I saw one of these law words, I knew it would be this sequence.
