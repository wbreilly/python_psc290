      "               Network activity in the lateral central amygdala (CeL) plays a crucial role in fear learning and emotional processing. However, the local circuits of the CeL are not fully understood and have only recently begun to be explored in detail. Here, we characterized the intrinsic circuits in the CeL using paired whole-call patch-clamp recordings, immunohistochemistry, and optogenetics in C57BL/6J wild-type and somatostatin-cre (SOM-Cre) mice. Our results revealed that throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the CeL, neurons form inhibitory connections at a rate of ∼29% with an average amplitude of 20 ± 3 pA (at −40 mV). Inhibitory input from a single neuron is sufficient to halt firing in the postsynaptic neuron.\n",

Finally, by optogenetically activating either SOM(+) or SOM(−) neurons, we found that almost all neurons in the CeL were innervated by these neuronal populations and that connections between like neurons were stronger than those between different neuronal types. These findings reveal a complex network of connections within the CeL and provide the foundations for future behavior-specific circuit analysis of this complex network.\n",

      "              Local inhibition in the lateral central amygdala (CeL) plays a crucial role in the processing of emotions, yet a complete understanding of these connections is still in its infancy. In this study, we show that CeL neurons are highly interconnected and that inhibition from a single neuron is sufficient to silence the postsynaptic neuron. Focusing on two well known CeL neuronal subtypes, protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ)-expressing and somatostatin (SOM)-expressing neurons, we show that the most common local connections are PKCδ(−) → PKCδ(−) and SOM(+) → SOM(+). Optogenetic activation of either the SOM(+) or SOM(−) neuronal populations revealed that inhibition was larger between like neurons. These findings show that within the CeL there is a complex network and provide the foundations for future behavior-specific circuit studies.\n",

To verify the expression of channelrhodopsin (ChR2) and to activate ChR2 in infected cells, an LED system (470 nm, 1.4 mW; pE-2 LED System, CoolLED) attached to the microscope (via the rear C-mount port) was used. A prolonged light pulse (100 ms) was used to verify that cells expressed functional ChR2. In the case of AAV2/5- EF1α.dflox.hChR2(H134R)-mCherry experiments, for example, neurons were considered SOM(+) if they were both fluorescent and displayed a prolonged depolarization in response to prolonged light stimulation (470 nm, 100 ms), whereas a SOM(−) neuron was not fluorescent and showed no excitation to the light pulse.

      "              The lateral CeA is involved in many types of behavioral regulation. Recent studies suggest that it contains multiple distinct neuronal populations and that these cell types exhibit differential long-range synaptic connectivity. However, the organization of local connections between various cell types remains less clear. Here the authors provide a detailed examination of inhibitory connections among and between somatostatin and PKC-delta expressing populations. The results indicate that more frequent connections exist within than between cell classes. These findings will help establish what types of local computation are supported by CeA neurons by providing a basic wiring diagram of the two major cell classes and demonstrating the function of associated GABAergic connections. The experiments were performed to a high standard, with complementary analyses leaving little room for alternative interpretation. For a somewhat more specialized audience the results will be of high interest. I have just a few main concerns:\n",

After struggling to understand authors' perspective, I feel like it would be beneficial for them to articulate more clearly why they think that the intrinsic circuitry exhibits more complexity than previously appreciated. Do they mean that there is more heterogeneity of firing phenotypes? If so, why did they not further parse their analysis of connectivity according to these subclasses? Or by complexity are they referring to the fact that there is more local connectivity within different classes than they anticipated?\n",

      "              The central nucleus of the amygdala, particularly the lateral portion (CeL), has become a center of attention in the study of fear memory following groundbreaking findings in the early 2000s by the groups of Stephen Maren and Joseph LeDoux. However, while several claims have been made regarding the local circuit organization of the CeL, a thorough interrogation of its intrinsic circuits have been missing. The present manuscript by Hunt et al. does much to fill that gap. Following a set of elegant experiments, they reach the important conclusion that connections between like-neurons are typically stronger than those between neurons of different types in CeL. And although, in light of previous publications, it is hard to interpret the overall meaning of these findings, at the very least they raise an important issue about the complexity of central amygdala circuits. This is of vital importance, because it confirms that most models of central amygdala fear circuits are extremely oversimplified and should be revised. Therefore, the contribution of the present manuscript is significant.\n",

      "              In general, the authors have done a good job at addressing the concerns raised during a previous review of their manuscript. And while I am satisfied with most changes, I want to highlight a few points that deserve attention:\n",

      "              1) Towards the end of the 3rd paragraph of the introduction the authors claim that SOM(+) neurons of CeL are likely to be the so-called CeLon neuons of the classic Ciocchi et al., 2010 paper, but that this has not been demonstrated. I disagree. I paper published this summer by Bo Li and colleagues (Yu et al., 2006 - Journal of Neuroscience) shows that SOM(+) neurons of CeL are activated following presentation of the CS+ in conditioned mice. The manuscript should include this important citation.\n",

      "             <p>\n",
      "              2) The results presented in Figure 8, 9 and 10 has an important caveat the authors should highlight. Because in these experiments SOM(+) neurons were labeled using a virus approach, it is possible that neurons that are non-fluorescent in these experiments (referred to as SOM(-)) are in fact SOM(+) neurons that were not infected with the virus. Therefore, connectivity rates in these experiments may be slightly compromised because of this. Particularly for SOM(-)-SOM(-) and SOM(+)-SOM(-) connections. It is not surprising to me that they found the single stuttering neuron in Figure 8c to be SOM(-). This could have been a SOM(+) neuron that didn't get infected by the virus. This problem could have been avoided using a Cre-dependent R26 reporter line. And, while I don't think the authors need to repeat these experiments, they should warn the reader that their approach limits the interpretation of the results.\n",

The precise circuits through which aversive states are orchestrated by 5-HT, however, have not yet been defined. Here we show that 5-HT from the dorsal raphe nucleus (5-HT<sup>DRN</sup>) enhances fear and anxiety and activates a subpopulation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (CRF<sup>BNST</sup>). Specifically, 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> projections to the BNST, via actions at 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors (5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs), engage a CRF<sup>BNST</sup> inhibitory microcircuit that silences anxiolytic BNST outputs to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). Further, we demonstrate that this CRF<sup>BNST</sup> inhibitory circuit underlies aversive behavior following acute exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). This early aversive effect is mediated via the corticotrophin releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF<sub>1</sub>R) given that CRF<sub>1</sub>R antagonism is sufficient to prevent acute SSRI-induced enhancements in aversive learning. These results reveal an essential 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup>→CRF<sup>BNST</sup> circuit governing fear and anxiety and provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the clinical observation of early adverse events to SSRI treatment in some patients with anxiety disorders<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R1\" id=\"__tag_577923714\" rid=\"R1\">1</a><sup>,</sup><a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R2\" id=\"__tag_577923729\" rid=\"R2\">2</a>.</p></div><div class=\"sec\"><strong class=\"kwd-title\">Keywords: </strong><span class=\"kwd-text\">Serotonin, BNST, anxiety, fear, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, CRF, VTA</span></div></div><div class=\"tsec sec headless whole_rhythm\" id=\"idm140509445870608\"><p class=\"p p-first\" id=\"P2\">In view of multiple converging lines of evidence pinpointing 5-HT as a critical neuromodulator of pathological fear learning<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R3\" id=\"__tag_577923738\" rid=\"R3\">3</a><sup>,</sup><a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R4\" id=\"__tag_577923730\" rid=\"R4\">4</a>, we first interrogated the endogenous recruitment of the 5-HT<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> circuit by an aversive footshock stimulus.

We observed eYFP+ (5-HT) cell bodies in the DRN and eYFP+ fibers in both the dorsal and ventral aspects of the BNST (<em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<sup>DRN→BNST</sup>), confirming a direct projection of 5-HT neurons originating in the DRN to the BNST (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1g-h</span></a>)<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R5\" id=\"__tag_577923734\" rid=\"R5\">5</a>.

Furthermore, bath application of the SSRI fluoxetine reliably decreased the rate of 5-HT reuptake, confirming that photostimulation of SERT+ terminals in the BNST originating from the DRN induces 5-HT release (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1k-l</span></a>).</p><p id=\"P4\">We next examined whether this 5-HT<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> circuit is functionally relevant for fear and anxiety-like behavior. To investigate this, <em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> mice were implanted with bilateral optical fibers and photostimulated in the BNST (473 nm, 20 Hz) using a standard tone-shock fear conditioning paradigm. Optogenetic stimulation of this pathway was paired with a tone that co-terminated with a scrambled footshock. Cued fear was assessed 24 hours after, and contextual fear 48 hours after, the initial fear acquisition session (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1m-n</span></a>). While no changes were observed during fear acquisition, both cued and contextual fear recall were significantly heightened in photostimulated <em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> mice (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1o-q</span></a>). We next assessed anxiety-like behavior using well-characterized assays, the elevated plus maze (EPM) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) tests. Upon stimulation with light, <em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> mice exhibited enhanced anxiety-like behavior in both the EPM and NSF (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1r-s</span></a> and <a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F5\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F5/\" rid-figpopup=\"F5\" rid-ob=\"ob-F5\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 2a-b</span></a>). Importantly, photostimulation did not induce hypolocomotion in the EPM or open field tests nor did it alter home-cage feeding, thus confirming that hypophagia in the NSF assay was due to anxiety and not a reduction in appetitive drive (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F5\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F5/\" rid-figpopup=\"F5\" rid-ob=\"ob-F5\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 2c-e</span></a>). One potential explanation of these results is that terminal stimulation in the BNST produces antidromic spikes in DRN cell bodies that release 5-HT in other brain regions, which could be also be driving these behaviors. In light of this, we probed the mechanism more deeply using converging approaches.</p><p id=\"P5\">To determine a receptor target through which 5-HT is signaling in the BNST, we then examined the impact of optogenetically evoked 5-HT<sup>DRN</sup> release on postsynaptic neuronal excitability and found a 3.05 ± 0.59 mV depolarization that was blocked by a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R antagonist (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F1\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F1/\" rid-figpopup=\"F1\" rid-ob=\"ob-F1\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 1t-u</span></a>). In contrast to previous reports demonstrating co-release of 5-HT and glutamate from DRN projections to the nucleus accumbens<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R6\" id=\"__tag_577923724\" rid=\"R6\">6</a>, we did not observe any time-locked light-evoked EPSCs in the BNST (data not shown). These results indicate that 5-HT<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> projections have a predominantly excitatory effect that is dependent on 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R signaling. To examine the role of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R containing neurons in anxiety-like behavior, we next took advantage of a <em>Htr2c<sup>Cre</sup></em> mouse line (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F6\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F6/\" rid-figpopup=\"F6\" rid-ob=\"ob-F6\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 3a-b</span></a>)<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R7\" id=\"__tag_577923716\" rid=\"R7\">7</a>. Using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs)<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R8\" id=\"__tag_577923733\" rid=\"R8\">8</a>, we found that activation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling in 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R-expressing neurons in the BNST significantly delayed the onset of feeding in the NSF assay without impacting home cage feeding behavior (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F6\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F6/\" rid-figpopup=\"F6\" rid-ob=\"ob-F6\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 3c-g</span></a>), thus phenocopying the effect observed with 5-HT<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> fiber stimulation during NSF. Taken together, these results provide converging evidence that activation of 5-HT<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> inputs elicits anxiety-like behavior via 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R signaling.</p><p id=\"P6\">We then considered the neurochemical phenotype of these target 5-HT<sup>DRN→</sup>5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R<sup>BNST</sup> neurons and hypothesized that 5-HT via 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R modulates the activity of neurons expressing the neuropeptide CRF. This hypothesis was based upon a previous analysis of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R knockout mice, which exhibit an anxiolytic phenotype associated with a reduction of c-fos in CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R9\" id=\"__tag_577923728\" rid=\"R9\">9</a>. Initially, using CRF reporter mice to <em>a priori</em> select CRF neurons for recordings, we found a heterogeneous 5HT-induced response of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F7\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F7/\" rid-figpopup=\"F7\" rid-ob=\"ob-F7\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 4a</span></a>), with only a subset demonstrating a depolarization. Consistent with this, double fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization revealed that only a subset of CRF neurons within the dorsal BNST (~70%) and ventral BNST (~43%%) express 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F7\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F7/\" rid-figpopup=\"F7\" rid-ob=\"ob-F7\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 4b-d</span></a>).</p><p id=\"P7\">While CRF signaling within the BNST is classically associated with anxiety-like behavior<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R10\" id=\"__tag_577923737\" rid=\"R10\">10</a><sup>,</sup><a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R11\" id=\"__tag_577923719\" rid=\"R11\">11</a>, more recent studies using circuit-based tools have found that optogenetic stimulation of GABAergic projections (which include CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons) to the VTA are anxiolytic<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R12\" id=\"__tag_577923715\" rid=\"R12\">12</a>. This led us to hypothesize the existence of functionally distinct subsets of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons that gate different behaviors and are differentially sensitive to 5HT. We used fluorescent retrograde tracer beads to label CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons as VTA-projecting or non-VTA-projecting (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F2\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F2/\" rid-figpopup=\"F2\" rid-ob=\"ob-F2\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 2a</span></a>) and found that VTA-projecting CRF neurons (CRF<sup>BNST→VTA</sup> neurons) were hyperpolarized by an average of 5.73 ± 1.24 mV and non-VTA-projecting CRF neurons were depolarized by an average of 2.74 ± 0.39 mV during 5-HT bath application. Moreover, the excitatory response to 5-HT in non-VTA-projecting CRF neurons was reversed in the presence of a 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonist (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F2\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F2/\" rid-figpopup=\"F2\" rid-ob=\"ob-F2\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 2b</span></a>). Furthermore, all CRF<sup>BNST→VTA</sup> neurons were non-responsive to the 5-HT<sub>2</sub>R agonist meta-Chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), while all non-VTA projecting CRF neurons were depolarized by mCPP by an average of 3.78 ± 1.17 mV (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F7\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F7/\" rid-figpopup=\"F7\" rid-ob=\"ob-F7\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 4e-h</span></a>). These findings suggest an anatomically distinct response to 5-HT by different subsets of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons. The subset of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons expressing 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs do not project to the VTA and are depolarized by 5-HT, whereas the CRF<sup>BNST→VTA</sup> neurons are hyperpolarized by 5-HT, via actions at another 5-HT receptor.</p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div class=\"fig iconblock whole_rhythm clearfix\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F2\" id=\"F2\"><a href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F2/\" rid-figpopup=\"F2\" rid-ob=\"ob-F2\" target=\"figure\"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode=\"anchored\" m1--><div class=\"figure\" data-largeobj=\"\" data-largeobj-link-rid=\"largeobj_idm140509439394032\"><a class=\"inline_block ts_canvas\" href=\"/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=5124365_emss-69526-f002.jpg\" target=\"tileshopwindow\"><div class=\"ts_bar small\" title=\"Click on image to zoom\"></div><img alt=\"An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.\n",

Noting the functional similarities between these two populations, we used retrograde tracing to determine that roughly ~58% of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons have projections to the LH or VTA (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F8\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F8/\" rid-figpopup=\"F8\" rid-ob=\"ob-F8\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 5d-f</span></a>).

To test this hypothesis, we injected <em>Crf<sup>Cre</sup></em> mice with a Cre-inducible ChR2 into the BNST and retrograde tracer beads into the VTA. We then recorded light-evoked IPSCs from non-ChR2 (ChR2-negative, retrograde tracer-positive) VTA-projecting BNST neurons (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F2\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F2/\" rid-figpopup=\"F2\" rid-ob=\"ob-F2\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 2c</span></a>).

Finally, to test if optically evoked 5-HT can inhibit BNST outputs to the VTA, we performed slice recordings in the BNST of <em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<sup>DRN→BNST</sup> mice and found that brief photostimulation of 5-HT terminals in the BNST increased sIPSCs on to VTA projecting BNST neurons in a manner similar to bath applied 5-HT (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F11\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F11/\" rid-figpopup=\"F11\" rid-ob=\"ob-F11\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 8a-c</span></a>).

Chemogenetic inhibition of CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons also significantly attenuated fluoxetine-induced enhancement of cued fear recall, providing proof of concept that augmentation of 5-HT via acute SSRI treatment recruits CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons to enhance fear-related behavior (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F3\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F3/\" rid-figpopup=\"F3\" rid-ob=\"ob-F3\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 3j-k</span></a>). Next, using connectivity based chemogenetic approaches; we tested whether inhibition of BNST outputs to the VTA and LH is a critical component of 5-HT→BNST-induced aversive states. We observed that activation of G<sub>q</sub> signaling in VTA- and LH-projecting BNST neurons, targeted by HSV-Cre-eYFP infused in the VTA and LH and Cre-dependent Gq-coupled DREADD infused in the BNST (HSV<sup>Cre</sup>::hM3Dq<sup>BNST</sup>), significantly attenuated fluoxetine enhancement of cued fear recall (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F3\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F3/\" rid-figpopup=\"F3\" rid-ob=\"ob-F3\" target=\"figure\"><span>Figure 3l-o</span></a>). Together, these data provide compelling evidence that acute fluoxetine engenders aversive behavior by recruiting CRF neurons in the BNST that in turn inhibit putative GABAergic (anxiolytic and stress buffering) outputs from the BNST to the VTA and LH. Pharmacological interventions that target this circuit may improve adverse symptoms during the initial weeks of SSRI treatment. Based on the critical role for CRF<sup>BNST</sup> neurons in fluoxetine induced aversive behavior, we examined the impact of a systemic CRF<sub>1</sub>R antagonist on SSRI enhancement of cued fear recall. Notably, blocking the CRF system reduced this aversive state and abolished the increase in sIPSCs in LH-projecting neurons in the BNST during bath application of 5-HT (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F12\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F12/\" rid-figpopup=\"F12\" rid-ob=\"ob-F12\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 9</span></a>). This provides translational evidence that CRF<sub>1</sub>R antagonists given in concert with SSRIs could be a promising treatment for anxiety disorders.</p><p class=\"p\" id=\"P13\">Taken together, these data reveal a discrete 5-HT responsive circuit in the BNST that underlies pathological anxiety and fear associated with a hyperserotonergic state (<a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F13\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F13/\" rid-figpopup=\"F13\" rid-ob=\"ob-F13\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data Figure 10</span></a>). SSRIs are currently a first-line treatment for anxiety and panic disorders but can acutely exacerbate symptoms, resulting in poor therapeutic compliance. Our results strongly implicate 5-HT engagement of a local BNST inhibitory microcircuit in acute SSRI induced aversive behaviors in rodents, and could potentially be involved in the early adverse events seen in clinical populations, emphasizing the need to identify compounds that selectively target both genetically-defined and pathway-specific cell populations.</p></div><div class=\"tsec sec\" id=\"S1\"><h2 class=\"head no_bottom_margin\" id=\"S1title\">Methods</h2><div class=\"sec sec-first\" id=\"S2\"><h3>Mice</h3><p class=\"p p-first\" id=\"P14\">Mice were used in all experiments.

Adult mice (2-5 months) were deeply anesthetized with 5% isoflurane (vol/vol) in oxygen and placed into a stereotactic frame (Kopf Instruments) while on a heated pad. Sedation was maintained at 1.5-2.5% isoflurane during surgery. An incision was made down the midline of the scalp and a craniotomy was performed above the target regions and viruses and fluorescent tracers were microinjected using a Neuros Hamilton syringe at a rate of 100 nl/min. After infusion, the needle was left in place for 10 minutes to allow for diffusion of the virus before the needle was slowly withdrawn. Injection coordinates (in mm, midline, Bregma, dorsal surface): BNST (±1.00, 0.30, -4.35), LH (±0.9 to 1.10, -1.7, -5.00 to -5.2), VTA (-0.3, -2.9, -4.6), DR (0.0, -4.65, -3.2 with a 23° angle of approach). When using retrobeads, injection volumes into the LH and VTA were 300 nl and 400 nl, respectively. Fluorogold injection volumes were 200 nl per target site. CTB volumes were 200200 nL per target site. An optical fiber was implanted in the BNST (±1.00, 0.20, -4.15) at a 10° angle for <em>in vivo</em> photostimulation studies. After fiber implantation, dental cement was used to adhere the ferrule to the skull. Following surgery, all mice returned to group housing.

Slices were optically stimulated with 20 5-ms blue (490 nm) light pulses at a rate of 20 Hz down the submerged 40x objective. 10 cyclic voltammograms were averaged prior to optical stimulation for background subtraction. Voltammograms were digitally smoothed one time with a fast Fourier transform following data collection and analyzed with HDCV (UNC Chapel Hill). Fluoxetine (10 µM) was bath applied following a stable baseline (20 minutes).</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S16\"><h3>Behavioral Assays</h3><p class=\"p p-first\" id=\"P33\">For chemogenetic manipulations, mice were transported to a holding cabinet adjacent to the behavioral testing room to habituate for at least 30 minutes before being pretreated with CNO (3 mg/kg, i.p. for <em>Crf<sup>Cre</sup></em> mice and 1 mg/kg, i.p. for <em>Htr<sub>2C</sub><sup>Cre</sup></em> mice). All behavior testing began 45 minutes following CNO treatment, with the exception of fear conditioning training, which occurred 30 minutes after a CNO injection. When assessing the effect of fluoxetine on fear conditioning, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), or vehicle, was administered 1 hour before training (30 minutes before CNO treatment). For optogenetic manipulations, mice received bilateral stimulation (473 nm, ~10 mW, 5 ms pulses, 20 Hz) when specified. Unless specified, all equipment was cleaned with a damp cloth between mouse trials. All sessions were video recorded and analyzed using EthoVision software (Noldus Information Technologies) except where noted.</p><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S17\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Elevated Plus Maze </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P34\">Mice were placed in the center of an elevated plus maze and allowed to explore during a 5 minute session. Light levels in the open arms were ~14 lux. During optogenetic manipulations mice received bilateral stimulation during the entire 5 minute session. Mice that left the maze were excluded from analysis (n= 2 control, 1 ChR2 from optogenetic experiments).</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S18\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Open Field </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P35\">Mice were placed into the corner of a white Plexiglas open field arena (25 x 25 x 25 cm) and allowed to freely explore for 30 minutes. The center of the open field was defined as the central 25% of the arena. For optogenetic studies the 30 minute session was divided into three 10-minute epochs consisting of stimulation off, stimulation on, and stimulation off periods.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S19\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Novelty-Induced Suppression of Feeding </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P36\">48 hours prior to testing mice were provided with access to a single piece of Froot Loops cereal (Kellogg’s) in their home cage. 24 hours prior to testing, home cage chow was removed and mouse body weights were recorded. Water remained available <em>ad lib</em>. Beginning at least one hour before testing mice transferred to new clean cages so they were singly housed for the test session and body weights were recorded. During the test session mice were placed into an arena (25×25×25 cm) that contained a single Froot Loop on top of a piece of circular filter paper. Mice were monitored by a live observer and the latency for the mouse to begin eating the pellet was measured, allowing up to 10 minutes. All mice began eating within this time. Following the initiation of feeding, mice were removed from the arena and placed back into their home cages. Mice were then provided with 10 minutes of access to a pre-weighed amount of Froot Loops™ for a post-test feeding session. After this 10 minute post-test, the remaining Froot Loops were weighed and mice were returned to <em>ad lib</em> home cage chow. Mice were returned to group housing at the end of this session. For optogenetic experiments, mice received constant 20 Hz optical stimulation during both the latency to feed assay and the 10 minute post-test. During optogenetic experiments, one control mouse did not feed during the 10 minute NSF session and was excluded from the results.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S20\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Home cage feeding </h4><p class=\"p p-first\" id=\"P37\"><em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em> mice were food deprived for 24 hours. On the day of the experiment, mice were acclimated to the behavior room for 1 hour. A single preweighed food pellet was placed in the home cage and the mice were allowed to eat for 10 minutes during optogenetic stimulation. At the end of the experimental session, the pellet was removed and weighed and mice were given <em>ad lib</em> access to food.</p><p class=\"p p-last\" id=\"P38\"><em>Htr<sub>2C</sub><sup>Cre</sup></em> mice were acclimated in metabolic chambers (TSE Systems, Germany) for 2 days before the start of the recordings. After acclimation, mice were food deprived for 24 hours. Following fasting, mice received an IP injection of CNO 30 minutes before food presented again. Mice were recorded for 12 hours with the following measurements being taken every 30 minutes: water intake, food intake, ambulatory activity (in X and Z axes), and gas exchange (O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>) (using the TSE LabMaster system, Germany). Energy expenditure was calculated according to the manufacturer’s guidelines (PhenoMaster Software, TSE Systems).</p></div><div class=\"sec sec-last\" id=\"S21\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Fear Conditioning </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P39\">We used a three day protocol to assess both cued and contextual fear recall. On the first day, mice were placed into a fear conditioning chamber (Med Associates) that contained a grid floor and was cleaned with a scented paper towel (19.5% EtOH, 79.5% H2O, 1% vanilla). After a 3 minute baseline period, mice were exposed to a 30 second tone (3 KHz, 80 dB) that co-terminated with a 2 second scrambled foot shock (0.6 mA). A total of 5 tone-shock pairings were delivered with a random inter-tone interval (ITI) of 60-120 seconds. For optogenetic studies, light stimulation occurred only during the 30-second tones of this session. Following delivery of the last foot shock, mice remained in the conditioning chamber for a two minute consolidation period. 24 hours later, mice were placed into a separate conditioning box (Med Associates) that contained a white Plexiglas floor, a striped pattern on the walls, and was cleaned and scented with a 70% EtOH solution. After a 3 minute baseline period, mice were presented with 10 tones (30 seconds, 3 KHz, 80 dB) with a 5 second ITI. Mice remained in the chamber after the last tone for a two-minute consolidation period. 24 hours later (48 hours after training), mice were returned to the original training chamber for 5 minutes. For each session, freezing behavior was hand-scored every 5 seconds by a trained observer blinded to experimental treatment as described previously<a class=\" bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip\" href=\"#R24\" id=\"__tag_577923725\" rid=\"R24\">24</a>. Freezing was defined as a lack of movement except as required for respiration.</p></div></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S22\"><h3>Immunohistochemistry and histology</h3><p class=\"p p-first\" id=\"P40\">All mice used for behavioral and anatomical tracing experiments were anesthetized with Avertin and transcardially perfused with 30 ml of ice-cold 0.01M PBS followed by 30 ml of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS. Brains were extracted and stored in 4% PFA for 24 hours at 4°C before being rinsed twice with PBS and stored in 30% sucrose/PBS until the brains sank. 45 µm slices were obtained on a Leica VT100S and stored in 50/50 PBS/Glycerol at -20°C. DREADD or ChR2-containing sections were mounted on slides, allowed to dry, coverslipped with VectaShield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA), and stored in the dark at 4°C.</p><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S23\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Tryptophan hydroxylase/Fluorogold/cfos triple labeling </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P41\">We stained free-floating dorsal raphe sections using indirect immunofluorescence sequentially for first tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) and Fluoro-Gold(FG) and then c-<em>fos</em>. For TPH/FG, we washed sections 3X for 5 min with 0.01 M PBS, permeabilized them for 30 min in 0.5% Triton/0.01 M PBS, and washed the sections again 2X with 0.01 M PBS. We blocked the sections for 1 hour in 0.1% Triton/0.01 M PBS containing 10%(v/v) Normal Donkey Serum and 1%(w/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). We then added primary antibodies (1:500 Mouse anti-TPH [Sigma Aldrich T0678] and 1:3000 Guinea Pig anti-Fluoro Gold [Protos Biotech NM101]) to blocking buffer and incubated the sections overnight at 4 degrees C. The next day, we washed the sections 3X for 5 min with 0.01 M PBS, then incubated them with 1:500 with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Donkey anti-mouse and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Donkey anti-guinea pig secondary antibodies for 2 hr at RT, and washed the sections 4X for 5 min with 0.01 M PBS. We then proceeded directly to the c-<em>fos</em> tyramide signal amplification based immunofluorescent staining. We permeabilized the sections in 50% methanol for 30 min, then quenched endogenous peroxidase activity in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. Followed by two 10 min washes in 0.01 M PBS, we blocked the sections in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1.0 % BSA for 1 hour. <em>c-fos</em> primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology - sc-52) was added to sections at 1:3000 and sections were incubated for 48 hours at 4 degrees. On day 3, we washed the sections in TNT buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) for 10 min, blocked in TNB buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.5% Blocking reagent – PerkinElmer FP1020) buffer for 30 min. We then incubated the sections in secondary antibody (Goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated- PerkinElmer) 1:200 in TNB buffer for 30 min., washed the sections in TNT buffer 4X for 5 min, and then incubated the sections in Cy3 dye diluted in TSA amplification diluents for 10 min. We washed the sections 2X in TNT buffer, mounted them on microscope slides. We coverslipped the slides using Vectashield mounting medium. We acquired 4-5 2x4 tiled z-stack(5 optical slices comprising 7 µm total) images of the dorsal raphe from each naïve and shock mouse on a Zeiss 800 Upright confocal microscope. Scanning parameters and laser power were matched between groups. Images were preprocessed using stitching and maximum intensity projection and then analyzed using an advanced processing module in Zeiss Zen Blue that allows nested analysis of multiple segmented fluorescent channels within parent classes. Double and triple-labeled cells were validated in a semi-automated fashion. At least 4 sections per mouse were counted in this way. One mouse was identified as a significant outlier in the Shock group and was excluded from further analysis.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S24\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\"><em>Sert<sup>Cre</sup></em>::ChR2<em>, and Crf<sup>Intrsect-</sup></em><sup>ChR2</sup> validation </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P42\">To verify expression of ChR2-expressing fibers in the BNST originating from DR serotonergic neurons, 300 µm slices used for <em>ex vivo</em> electrophysiological recordings containing the DR and BNST were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 24 hours before being rinsed with PBS, mounted, and coverslipped with Vectashield mounting medium. Images showing eYFP fluorescence from the DR and BNST were obtained on a Zeiss 800 upright confocal microscope using a 10x objective and tiled z stacks. To validate the INTRSECT construct, mice received injections of HSV-hEF1α-mCherry or HSV-ef1α-LSL1-mCherry-IRES-flpo to both the LH and VTA bilaterally (N=4 and 5, respectively). Both groups received AAVDJ-hSyn-Cre-on/Flp-off-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP to the BNST bilaterally. Six weeks following injection, mice were perfused and tissue was collected as described above. To visualize YFP expression in the BNST of <em>Crf<sup>Cre</sup></em>::Intrsect<sup>BNST</sup> mice, free floating slices containing the BNST were rinsed three times with PBS for 5 minutes each. Slices were then incubated in 50% methanol for 30 minutes then incubated in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 minutes. Following three 10-minute washes in PBS, slices were incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 minutes followed by a 10 minute PBS wash. Slices were blocked in 10% normal donkey serum/0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 hour, and then they were incubated overnight at 4°C with a primary chicken anti-GFP antibody (GFP-1020, Aves) at 1:500 in blocking solution. Following primary incubation, slices were rinsed three times with 0.01M PBS for 10 minutes each and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (AlexaFluor 488 Donkey anti-chicken) at 1:200 in PBS for 2 hours at room temperature. Slices were then rinsed with four 10-minute PBS washes before being mounted onto glass slides and coverslipped with Vectashield with DAPI. A 3x4 tiled z stack (7 optical sections comprising 35 µm total) image from both the left and right hemispheres of the BNST was obtained at 20x magnification using a Zeiss 800 upright confocal microscope. Scanning parameters and laser power were matched between groups. Images were preprocessed using stitching and maximum intensity projection. The number of fluorescent cells in the dorsal and ventral aspects of the BNST were counted by a blinded scorer using the cell counter plug-in in FIJI (ImageJ). Each hemisphere was considered independently per mouse. One mouse in the flp-expressing group was a significant outlier for number of cells expressed in a ventral BNST hemisphere (ROUT, Q=0.1%) and all data from that mouse were excluded.</p></div><div class=\"sec sec-last\" id=\"S25\"><p></p><h4 class=\"inline\">Choleratoxin retrograde tracer studies in CRF reporter mice </h4><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P43\">3 male CRF-L10a reporter mice were injected with 200 nl of CTB 555 and CTB 647 bilaterally to the LH and VTA, respectively, as described above. 5 days following injection, mice were perfused as described above, the brains were extracted, and were stored in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours at 4°C before being rinsed with PBS and transferred to 30% sucrose until the brains sank. 45 µm sections containing the BNST were collected as described above. Sections containing the BNST were mounted on glass slides and coverslipped using Vectashield. An image from the left and right hemispheres of a medial section of the BNST was obtained on a Zeiss 800 upright microscope using a 20x objective and 3x5 tiled z stacks (5 optical slices comprising 7 µm total). Images were preprocessed using stitching and maximum intensity projection, and were then analyzed using the cell counter function in FIJI (ImageJ). Only cells positive for GFP (putative CRF neurons) were considered. Cells were scored exclusively as either 555+ only (LH-projecting), 647+ only (VTA-projecting), 555+ and 647+ (projecting to both LH and VTA), or 555- and 647- (unlabeled; neither LH- nor VTA- projecting). The total number of CRF neurons scored was calculated as the sum of all four groups, and percentages of each type were calculated from this value. Each hemisphere was scored and plotted independently (N=6 images from 3 mice), and the dorsal and ventral BNST were considered separately. The average values were plotted as pie charts (ED 9).</p></div></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S26\"><h3>Double Fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization (FISH)</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P44\">For validation of 2C-cre line and comparison of CRF/2C mRNA cellular colocalization, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane, rapidly decapitated, and brains rapidly extracted. Immediately after removal, the brains were placed on a square of aluminum foil on dry ice to freeze. Brains were then placed in a -80°C freezer for no more than 1 week before slicing. 12 µm slices were made of the BNST on a Leica CM3050S cryostat (Germany) and placed directly on coverslips. FISH was performed using the Affymetrix ViewRNA 2-Plex Tissue Assay Kit with custom probes for CRF, 5-HT2C, and Cre designed by Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Slides were coverslipped with SouthernBiotech DAPI Fluoromount-G. (Birmingham, AL). 3x5 tiled z stack (15 optical sections comprising 14 µm total) images of the entire 12 µm slice were obtained on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope for assessment of CRF/2C colocalization. A single-plane 40x tiled image of a CRF/2C slice was obtained on a Zeiss 800 upright confocal microscope for the magnified image shown in <a class=\"fig-table-link fig figpopup\" co-legend-rid=\"lgnd_F9\" href=\"/pmc/articles/PMC5124365/figure/F9/\" rid-figpopup=\"F9\" rid-ob=\"ob-F9\" target=\"figure\"><span>Extended Data 6b</span></a>, right. 3x5 tiled z stack (7 optical sections comprising 18 µm) images of 2C/Cre slices were obtained on a Zeiss 800 upright confocal microscope for the 2C/Cre validation. All images were preprocessed with stitching and maximum intensity projection. An image of the BNST from 3 mice in each condition was hand counted for each study using the cell counter plugin in FIJI (ImageJ). Cells were classified into three groups: probe 1+, probe 2+, or probe 1 and 2 +. Only cells positive for a probe were considered. Results are plotted as average classified percentages across the three images.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S27\"><h3>Group assignment</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P45\">No specific method of randomization was used to assign groups. Animals were assigned to experimental groups so as to minimize the influence of other variables such as age or sex on the outcome.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S28\"><h3>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P46\">Pre-established criteria for excluding mice from behavioral analysis included 1) missed injections, 2) anomalies during behavioral testing, such as mice falling off the elevated plus maze, 3) damage to or loss of optical fibers, 4) statistical outliers, as determined by the Grubb’s test.</p></div><div class=\"sec\" id=\"S29\"><h3>Sample size</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P47\">A power analysis was used to determine the ideal sample size for behavior experiments. Assuming a normal distribution, a 20% change in mean and 15% variation, we determined that we would need 8 mice per group. In some cases, mice were excluded due to missed injections or lost optical fibers resulting in fewer than 8 mice per group. For electrophysiology experiments, we aimed for 5-7 cells from 3-4 mice.</p></div><div class=\"sec sec-last\" id=\"S30\"><h3>Statistics</h3><p class=\"p p-first-last\" id=\"P48\">Data are presented as means ± SEM. For comparisons with only two groups, <em>p</em> values were calculated using paired or unpaired t-tests as described in the figure legends. Comparisons across more than two groups were made using a one-way ANOVA, and a two-way ANOVA was used when there was more than one independent variable. A Bonferonni posttest was used following significance with an ANOVA. In cases in which ANOVA was used, the data met the assumptions of equality of variance and independence of cases. If the condition of equal variances was not met, Welch’s correction was used. Some of the sample groups were too small to detect normality (&lt;8 samples) but parametric tests were used because nonparametric tests lack sufficient power to detect differences in small samples (Graphpad Statistics Guide – <a href=\"http://www.graphpad.com\" ref=\"reftype=extlink&amp;article-id=5124365&amp;issue-id=279713&amp;journal-id=358&amp;FROM=Article%7CBody&amp;TO=External%7CLink%7CURI&amp;rendering-type=nihms\" target=\"pmc_ext\">www.graphpad.com</a>). The standard error of the mean is indicated by error bars for each group of data. Differences were considered significant at <em>p</em> values below 0.05.
